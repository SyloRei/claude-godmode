# Story Planner

Converts PRDs into stories.json — executable story specifications with auto-detected quality gates, ready for `/execute`.

---

## The Job

1. Read the PRD (markdown file or user-provided text)
2. Auto-detect project quality gate commands
3. Convert to stories.json format
4. Save to `.claude-pipeline/stories.json` (create `.claude-pipeline/` dir if needed)

---

## Output Format

```json
{
  "project": "[Project Name]",
  "branchName": "[feature-name-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Feature description]",
  "qualityGates": {
    "typecheck": "[detected command, e.g. pnpm type-check]",
    "lint": "[detected command, e.g. pnpm lint]",
    "test": "[detected command, e.g. pnpm test]",
    "build": "[detected command, e.g. pnpm build]"
  },
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Criterion 1",
        "Criterion 2",
        "All quality gates pass"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

## Auto-Detect Quality Gates

Before converting, detect project quality commands:

| Gate | Check for |
|------|-----------|
| typecheck | `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy`, `pyright`, `cargo check`, `go vet` |
| lint | `eslint`, `ruff check`, `cargo clippy`, `golangci-lint` |
| test | `vitest`, `jest`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `go test` |
| build | `tsup`, `cargo build`, `go build`, `webpack` |

Read package.json scripts, Makefile, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml to detect exact commands.

## Story Size: The Number One Rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE agent session (one context window).**

### Right-sized:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" → schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" → schema, middleware, login UI, session handling

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, split it.

---

## Story Ordering: Dependencies First

1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Dashboard/summary views that aggregate data

Earlier stories must NOT depend on later ones.

---

## Acceptance Criteria: Must Be Verifiable

**Good:** "Add `status` column with default 'pending'" / "Filter dropdown has options: All, Active, Completed"
**Bad:** "Works correctly" / "Good UX" / "Handles edge cases"

**Every story MUST end with:** `"All quality gates pass"`

This aligns with the canonical quality gates defined in CLAUDE.md.

---

## Conversion Rules

1. Each user story → one JSON entry
2. IDs: Sequential (US-001, US-002, ...)
3. Priority: dependency order first, then document order
4. All stories: `passes: false`, empty `notes`
5. branchName: derived from feature, kebab-case
6. qualityGates: auto-detected project commands
7. Final criterion always: "All quality gates pass"

---

## Archiving Previous Runs

Before writing `.claude-pipeline/stories.json`, check if one exists from a different feature:
1. Read current `.claude-pipeline/stories.json`
2. If `branchName` differs from new feature:
   - Archive to `.claude-pipeline/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
   - Copy `stories.json` and `progress.txt`
   - Reset `.claude-pipeline/progress.txt`

---

## After Saving

Suggest next steps:
1. **Optional:** "Use `@architect` to review the design before implementing"
2. **"Run `/execute` to start implementing stories with `@executor` + `@reviewer` agents"**

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Quality gates auto-detected and populated
- [ ] Each story completable in one agent session
- [ ] Stories ordered by dependency
- [ ] Every story ends with "All quality gates pass"
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable (not vague)
- [ ] No story depends on a later story
